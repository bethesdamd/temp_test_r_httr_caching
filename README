Experiments with R Shiny, creating some apps for the first time.
Testing retrieving data from a remote https endpoint (github raw file).
Testing whether the shiny app retrieves the remote data every time the app is loaded, or if it caches the data...?
It reloads the data each time the shiny app page is reloaded, from what I can tell.  Or, at least,
I'm changing the data file and the app is reflecting the change.
